    "about.definition.title": "Definition",
    "about.definition.history": "The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a mathematical tool for decision making. Created by the American mathematician Thomas L. Saati in the 1970s.",
    "about.definition.main": "The method involves presenting a complex problem as a hierarchy of objectives, parameters and alternatives. The solution to the problem is through a paired comparison procedure at each level of the hierarchy.",
    "about.applications.title": "Applications",
    "about.applications.problems": "The analytic hierarchy process is used to solve a wide range of problems. Initially, the method was developed to solve the problem of contingency planning. Further, the method was used in such tasks as: energy distribution, capital investment in conditions of uncertainty, fight against terrorism and many others.",
    "about.applications.advantages-title": "The analytic hierarchy process has the following advantages:",
    "about.applications.advantages-universality": "universality;",
    "about.applications.advantages-psychological-aspects": "consideration of psychological aspects of decision-making;",
    "about.applications.advantages-consistency": "the presence of a formalized method to calculate the consistency of both the solution and the intermediate results obtained in the pairwise comparisons.",
    "about.applications.advantages-drawbacks": "The main disadvantage of the method is the need to obtain a large number of evaluations from the expert. So, if you need to compare 7 objects by 7 parameters, you will have to make 168 paired comparisons, which is quite a lot.",
    "about.description.title": "Description",
    "about.description.sequence-of-actions": "The sequence of actions required to implement the method:",
    "about.description.problem-as-hierarchical-structure-title": "Presenting the problem as a hierarchical structure.",
    "about.description.problem-as-hierarchical-structure-main": "Usually three levels of hierarchies are used to solve the problem. At the highest level of the hierarchy there is a goal - a question to be answered. At the next level of the hierarchy are the parameters against which the objects (alternatives) will be evaluated, the choice of one of which is necessary to achieve the goal. At the last level of the hierarchy are the objects to be compared.",
    "about.description.procedure-of-pairwise-comparisons-title": "Performing a pairwise comparison procedure.",
    "about.description.procedure-of-pairwise-comparisons-hierarchy": "At each level of the hierarchy, it is necessary to make a pairwise comparison of all elements of the given level in relation to the element of the higher level. Thus, the parameters are compared with each other in relation to the goal, alternatives in relation to each parameter.",
    "about.description.procedure-of-pairwise-comparisons-saati-scale": "Of al l the objects at this level of the hierarchy, two are selected and compared with each other using a special \"Saati scale\". This scale has 9 divisions, each of which reflects the degree of preference of one object for another. The table below provides an explanation for each division of the Saati scale.",
    "about.description.procedure-of-pairwise-comparisons-result": "The results of pairwise comparisons of all objects are recorded as a matrix. An example of such a matrix containing the results of comparisons of three objects can be seen in the table below.",
    "about.description.procedure-of-pairwise-comparisons-matrix": "Each cell of this matrix contains a value from the \"Saati scale\", which shows how much the object corresponding to the matrix row is preferable to the object corresponding to the matrix column.",
    "about.description.procedure-of-pairwise-comparisons-inverse-values": "Inverse values, such as: \"1/5\", \"1/9\" - indicate that the degree of preference should be read in the opposite direction. Thus, the value \"1/5\" in the matrix means that the degree of preference for the object corresponding to the column, to the object corresponding to the row, is equal to 5.",

    "about.description.vectors-of-priorities-title": "Calculation of priority vectors and consistency of decision. After filling in the matrix of pairwise comparisons, it is necessary to calculate the vector of priorities for this matrix, in mathematical terms - the main own vector, which after normalization becomes the vector of priorities. You can also calculate the consistency of the comparison matrix, which shows how consistent the comparisons are.",
    "about.description.vectors-of-priorities-main": "These comparisons and calculations set priorities for elements of some level of the hierarchy relative to one element of the next level. If there are more than two levels, different priority vectors can be combined into priority matrices from which one final priority vector for the lower level is defined.",

    "about.example.goal": "First of all, it is necessary to define the target:",
    "about.example.description": "Details of the task should be placed in the description:",
    "about.example.criteria": "Next, you need to list all the compared objects. It is also necessary to list all the parameters by which these objects are evaluated:",
    "about.example.object-comparisons": "After all the parameters are listed, you can start comparing them. One of the two views can be used to make paired comparisons: \"Comparison List\" or \"Comparison Matrix\".",
    "about.example.comparison-control": "The \"Comparison List\" is intended for those who do not yet have a good understanding of the hierarchy analysis method. In this view, a drop-down list corresponds to each comparison, with the help of which you can set the necessary degree of preference of the upper object to the lower one.",
    "about.example.comparison-matrix": "The \"Comparison Matrix\" is for experts. And it allows you to directly change the state of the pairwise comparison matrix. Each cell of the matrix, except the cells of the main diagonal, can be edited. The cell can take values from the \"Saati scale\" and vice versa. After changing the value of the cell, the value of the \"symmetrical\" matrix cell will also be changed.",
    "about.example.pairwise-comparisons": "Next, you need to perform pairwise comparisons of the objects for each of the parameters. Comparisons are made in the same way as the comparison of parameters.",

    "about.example.consistency-ratio": "The table below contains a list of matrices and their corresponding consistency ratios. The consistency ratio shows how consistent the comparisons are. If the matrix consistency ratio is less than 0.1, the comparisons in this matrix are considered to be sufficiently consistent (consistent). Otherwise, comparisons in this matrix are considered to be inconsistent and should be made anew.",
